# Nand2Tetris
[Build a Modern Computer from First Principles](https://www.nand2tetris.org/)

- All combinational chips are constructed from Nand gates.
- All sequential chips are constructed from DFF gates, and combinational chips.

## Architecture
- 16-bit computer.
- von Neumann architecture (same data bus to read/write to/from the memory and to fetch instructions).
- 32KB of RAM (16K registers of 16 bits).

## Tools
For original Nand2Tetris, use the course provided tools.

For VHDL :

- ghdl
- gtkwave

## TODO 
- Part > 4 for original nand2tetris.
- Simple computer in VHDL with no IO.
- Simple compiler for JACK.
- Try to make an interactive simulation in VHDL following [https://www.fpgarelated.com/showarticle/20.php].
- Try to port it to a real FPGA board.
